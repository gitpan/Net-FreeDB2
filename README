FREEDB MODULES IN SHORT

- Easy FreeDB/CDDB file handling.
- Connect to FreeDB/CDDB servers.
- Using both CDDBP and HTTP protocols.
- With HTTP proxy support (user and password).


DESCRIPTION

This distribution first of all contains the FreeDB Perl module hierarchy. These
modules are intended to make the access to FreeDB/CDDB servers easier by
abstraction of the FreeDB/CDDB protocols and mechanisms.

Secondly, a few programs (fdcdi, fdlscat, fdmotd, fdoggenc, fdquery, fdrip
and fdsites) are provided to illustrate the usage of the FreeDB
Perl module hierarchy.
