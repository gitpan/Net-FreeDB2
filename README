Net::FreeDB2 modules in short
    *  Easy FreeDB/CDDB file handling.
    * Connect to FreeDB/CDDB servers.
    * Using both CDDBP and HTTP protocols.
    * With HTTP proxy support (user and password).
    * Read Net::FreeDB2 (3) as introduction.


Description
    * This distribution first of all contains the Net::FreeDB2 Perl module hierarchy. These
      modules are intended to make the access to FreeDB/CDDB servers easier by abstraction
      of the FreeDB/CDDB protocols and mechanisms.
    * Secondly, a few programs (fdcdi, fdlscat, fdmotd, fdoggenc, fdquery, fdrip and
      fdsites) are provided to illustrate the usage of the FreeDB Perl module hierarchy.
    * Net::FreeDB2 is another FreeDB/CDDB access class hierarchy. The basics are similar
      to the other FreeDB/CDDB Perl modules.
      However, in the writers opinion, the details differ enough for it to have a certain
      right of existence. It's organization is inspired by Net::LDAP. 


Prerequisites
    * cdparanoia to read audio tracks.
    * Error module for exception handling.
    * LWP::UserAgent module for HTTP support.
    * HTTP::Request module for HTTP support.
    * IO::Socket::INET module for CDDBP support.
